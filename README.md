# Fractal Tree Generator

This is a fractal tree generator built using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to create recursive fractal trees with various customizable parameters. You can also export the trees as PNG images and save/load the parameters as JSON files.

## Features
- Adjustable recursion depth, branch angles, and lengths.
- Randomness for more natural-looking trees.
- Export generated trees as PNG images.
- Save and load tree settings in JSON format.
- Randomize tree parameters for unique trees every time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (for exporting images)

Install the dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage
Run the script using Python:

python fractal_tree_generator.py


A GUI will appear where you can adjust the tree parameters and see the results in real time.

## Export
You can export your tree by clicking the "Export as PNG" button, which saves the current fractal tree as an image file.
